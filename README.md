# Fermyon Summer of Spin

**Dive¬†into a fun opportunity to learn about Spin and our other projects!** üèäüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

If you‚Äôre new to Advent of Spin or a returning participant, we are excited to announce that Fermyon is doing a ‚Äú*Spin*‚Äù-off on the yearly [Advent of Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/advent-of-spin) event that we typically host during the winter seasons. For this season, we will be releasing summer themed coding challenges.

Learning and trying out a new technology for the first time can be a learning curve, but the team at Fermyon strives to make this process fun. The technology we‚Äôre really excited about is serverside¬†[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)¬†and believe that Wasm will power the next wave of cloud computing.¬†[Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin)¬†is an open-source framework for building and running serverless applications powered by WebAssembly.

Fermyon built Spin to ensure a better experience for developers, and our coding challenges for this summer will allow you to ease into the technology. With these fun coding challenges, you‚Äôll be able to find your footing with Spin and WebAssembly. At the end of each challenge, you‚Äôll learn some valuable skills as a developer, and write and deploy your own Spin applications. 

Starting on July 29th to the middle of August, we will be updating this repository every Monday with a weekly challenge for you to learn how to write WebAssembly applications. The challenges are intended to resemble a learning progression, which will contain simple to complex concepts like simple static sites, key value store, LLMs, etc. 

If you‚Äôre confused or unsure on how to proceed with the exercises, we will release a walkthrough video of the challenge's solution a week after it has been posted. We will be releasing these walkthroughs [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGgsMYwLxmIgv1lXaActZqw).

## **How Do I Participate?**

Simply click on each challenge, and follow the instructions.

After releasing each a challenge, a walkthrough of the solution will be posted a week after. Stay tuned!

## **Pre-Requisites**

To participate you need to have the following installed:

- [Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/quickstart)
- [Hurl](https://hurl.dev/docs/installation.html)
- A¬†[Fermyon Cloud](https://cloud.fermyon.com/)¬†account (it's free!)

## **Submitting Your Work**
Have you completed a challenge and validated your solution through Hurl? Make sure to fill out this [TypeForm](https://fibsu0jcu2g.typeform.com/to/xrzb0kRt) to receive a Fermyon prize sticker! You also have the opportunity to be recognized on our Discord for completing the challenge (though this is completely optional and up to you).

## **Nobody Must Code Alone!**

We‚Äôre all around in the¬†[Fermyon Discord server](https://www.fermyon.com/discord). Come hang out, ask questions, and help others out as we work through the season‚Äôs challenges. This is a great opportunity to meet others in the community as well as the engineers behind the Spin project and Fermyon Cloud.

We‚Äôll also post on¬†[X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/fermyontech)¬†and¬†[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fermyon), dropping some helpful resources and videos.

Yes, the main goal of Summer of Spin is to get you solving problems and learning the technology. But we also hope that you‚Äôll find inspiration in these projects to build something on your own. If that inspiration happens to strike, let us know. We love hearing about the amazing things you build!
