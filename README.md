# Fermyon Summer of Spin

**Dive into a fun opportunity to learn about Spin and our other projects!** 🏊🏻‍♀️

If you’re new to Advent of Spin or a returning participant, we are excited to announce that Fermyon is doing a “*Spin*”-off on the yearly [Advent of Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/advent-of-spin) event that we typically host during the winter seasons. For this season, we will be releasing summer themed coding challenges.

Learning and trying out a new technology for the first time can be a learning curve, but the team at Fermyon strives to make this process fun. The technology we’re really excited about is serverside [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and believe that Wasm will power the next wave of cloud computing. [Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) is an open-source framework for building and running serverless applications powered by WebAssembly.

Fermyon built Spin to ensure a better experience for developers, and our coding challenges for this summer will allow you to ease into the technology. With these fun coding challenges, you’ll be able to find your footing with Spin and WebAssembly. At the end of each challenge, you’ll learn some valuable skills as a developer, and write and deploy your own Spin applications. 

Starting in late July to the middle of August, we will be updating this repository every Tuesday with a weekly challenge for you to learn how to write WebAssembly applications. The challenges are intended to resemble a learning progression, which will contain simple to complex concepts like simple static sites, key value store, LLMs, etc. 

If you’re confused or unsure on how to proceed with the exercises, we will go over a solution and present each challenge in our weekly Live Code Tuesdays on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@fermyontech/streams). 

## **How Do I Participate?**

Simply click on each challenge, and follow the instructions.

## Challenges

Challenges will be added here weekly on Mondays, with the first challenge starting on July 29th. A walkthrough video will also be released after each challenge week.

## **Pre-Requisites**

To participate you need to have the following installed:

- [Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/quickstart)
- [Hurl](https://hurl.dev/docs/installation.html)
- A [Fermyon Cloud](https://cloud.fermyon.com/) account (it's free!)

## **Nobody Must Code Alone!**

We’re all around in the [Fermyon Discord server](https://www.fermyon.com/discord). Come hang out, ask questions, and help others out as we work through the season’s challenges. This is a great opportunity to meet others in the community as well as the engineers behind the Spin project and Fermyon Cloud.

We’ll also post on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/fermyontech) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fermyon), dropping some helpful resources and videos.

Yes, the main goal of Summer of Spin is to get you solving problems and learning the technology. But we also hope that you’ll find inspiration in these projects to build something on your own. If that inspiration happens to strike, let us know. We love hearing about the amazing things you build!
